# Thesis
N-mix abundance analysis and unmarked formatting scripts for marsh birds  

1. N-mix model scripts are labeled with species alpha code and year(s) examined (ex: CLRApc21.R). The same modeling approach was used to investigate local variable effects in the scripts titled with "alphacode"Local.R
2. Formatting count data for unmarked pcount frame is generally outlined in DataFormatClean.R
3. Additional formatting was conducted for each species (count matrix) with truncation and accounting for zeros in pc.counts.R
4. Formatting local vegetation matrices is outlined in localveg.R
5. Formatting remote landscape variables is outlined in landscapecovs.R
